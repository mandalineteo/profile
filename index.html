        <h2>About me üëßüèª</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, I was a curious child who loved taking things apart to understand how they worked, and I would attempt to rebuild them. Whether or not I succeeded in rebuilding them, I viewed these experiences as opportunities to acquire new knowledge.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Later, during my teenage years, as Blogspot gained popularity, I would spend hours deciphering codes that I obtained from other webpages to enhance my own page's aesthetics. I sought out different code snippets, experimenting on my page to discover what worked and what didn't. I was fascinated by the functionality and potential of each piece of code.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">My curiosity and desire to explore led me to choose biology as my academic path, where I aimed to understand the intricacies of life to answer the questions I had, and eventually found myself working in healthcare. Witnessing the impact of technology's successes and failures at my workplace was a turning point for me as it prompted me to learn coding to solve problems and improve existing solutions. I now look forward to putting what I have learned into practice.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">During my free time, I enthusiastically pursue learning and reading to satisfy my curiosity. Exploring the vast world of programming, I'm eager to acquire new languages, frameworks, and concepts to further develop my skills as a developer.</p>
